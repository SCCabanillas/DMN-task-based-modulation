# Task Based Modulation of the Default Mode Network

### ICA naming scheme
The ICA nii files are named according to the output of the algorithm. It is noteworthy that on the paper the following notation was preferred: ICA4_1 as ICA3, ICA4_2 as ICA4, ICA4_3 as IC2, ICA4_4 as IC1. Also, the latter was multiplied by -1.
